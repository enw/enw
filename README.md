- 👋 Hi, I’m @enw here, Elliot to normal people.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping you solve your problems using software, user-centered design, agile practices, machine learning, scalable backend and data systems.  Sheesh I know that sounds like lots o' buzzwords but I'm interested in and able to use all of those things to put together and execute on a plan to do all of those things!
- 🌱 I’m helping friends solve ML, Software Engineering, Software Architecture, and Strategy problems.  Building stuff in collaboration with LLMs.  Jazz piano and guitar.  Ableton and MPC Beats.  Playing with my kids.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your project.  :).  Let me know what you need.  
- 📫 How to reach me - [mail me](mailto:elliot.winard@gmail.com)
