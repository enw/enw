- 👋 Hi, I’m @enw here, Elliot to normal people.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping you solve your problems using software, user-centered design, agile practices, machine learning, scalable backend and data systems.  Sheesh I know that sounds like lots o' buzzwords but I'm interested in and able to use all of those things to put together and execute on a plan to do all of those things!
- 🌱 I’m currently leading an Engineering team at Stability.AI.  Occasionally helping a friend quickly turn markdown into HTML & web-apps.  Making E-books.  Jazz piano and guitar.  Ableton.  Playing with my kids.
<!-- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your project.  :).  Let me know what you need.   -->
